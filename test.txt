[[On September 22nd, SEHS held a wonderful lecture of law by Mr. Lei Cao, a judge from intermediate people's court. Mr. Xianghe Han, vice principal of SEHS, and several directors attended the lecture. The vice principal invited him to become our lecturer of law and gave contract to Mr.Lei Cao in person.
The lecture was in charge of Gang Lin, the vice-director of Youth League Committee. The lecture concludes four parts, which are swindled, accident, sexually harass, network crimes and the way of defense of those criminality. His lecture not only concludes basic juris knowledge but also many actual examples. That made students begins to have a better understanding of those articles of law.This is also a new cognize to these high school students who are already bear fully legal liability.
Judge Cao educates the students about the legal consciousness while instructing the legal knowledge. He teaches students not to encroach on others’ benefits when protecting themselves, thinking twice before donging something to avoid the tragedy caused by a momentary impulse.  A mass of examples and data make them realize that accidents and crimes actually happen around us every day. The rate is more enormous than imagination. One after another statement of the case not only motivates students to think how to protect themselves, but also establishing the awareness of the contribution in perfecting the social security law system. In the end, the lecture culminates in the summary speech of deputy secretary Lin.

The aim is to help students to know the laws and abide by them, reinforce the consciousness of law, make a contribution to harmonious society and safety campus.
