Hao Ruochen, the student who came from the International Department of SEHS became the captain of this team and embarked on his road with Liu Zhize, Xiang Zhanhong, Liu Yuhan and Guan Tianrui. Who are the other four leaguers in his team. From 24th Aug. to 5th Sept. Two male students, Hao Ruochen and Guan Tianrui taught the students in QuMei Township Primary School and the other three female students, Liu Zhize, Xiang Zhanhong and Liu Yuhan, went to Shigatse NO.1 Middle School. In this aid-education activity, everyone in this team had his/her own experience.</p><p>During the days when they had taught in Qumei township primary school, Hao Ruochen and Guan Tianrui taught science, Chinese, English and math classes. These two little teachers had opened up a new door for the students in Qumei township primary school in several days. Besides teaching them knowledge, they also imparted them some experience of study and life. They held the math competition, the concert of Tibet music and established a free wi-fi for the school and Qumei  township. They also held an award-giving ceremony to cite the students who had an outstanding behavior. (For example, there were some awards called little scientists, little mathematical specialists, the students of dandelion seeds, English talents, little guards of the campus, representatives of peace, etc.) These two teachers made the mute English more exciting and easier to speak successfully. The children became interested in English indeed. At the same time,They also selected “the students of dandelion seeds”and decided to start a one-year plan to help those students both in study and life after getting back to Shandong.</p><p>Since Liu Zhize, Xiang Zhanhong, and Liu Yuhan come from the international department of SEHS and have higher English levels, principal Yang from Shigatse No.1 Middle school gave the English teaching work as well as physics classes and art classes of Senior 2 class 3, 5 and 6 to these members of Dandelion Association. During the days in Shigatse No.1 Middle school, these 3 teachers used creative methods to finish the study of international alphabet, organized interesting art classes, held the class conference which set “Study hard, and go to high schools in inland”as its title, and bestowed prizes for those students who behaved excellently in class. ( such as smiling angels, wisdom stars, sunshine boys, and hope stars). These teachers also used their spare time to sort out books in the school library, and formulated new book-donation plan with principal Yang. They also selected some “Dandelion Seeds Students”, who will be provided with some help in study and life when these teachers go back to inland.</p><p> When they did the teacher support in Tibet, both five young teachers and cute children learned lots of stuff. “Ms.Liu, you make me like to learn English sincerely.”Miss.Xiang, you are the first teacher who told me that you like me. I will work hard in the future and go to your hometown. I want to find you and see you again.”“Mr.Hao, you are the only teacher who teaches us with a smile. All of us love you.”  “Mr.Guan, you are the sun of my life.”These words were written by those children to the teachers in the farewell letters. Obviously, this activity had made the children realize the meaning of Dandelion - To spread seed to distant areas, to bring hope everywhere, to enlighten the lives of as many children as we can.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141031104915532.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141031104915534.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141031104915533.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141031104915535.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/141031104915531.png" /><p>Translated by: Liu Zhize.

Professor Siyue Wang, Made a Report on Innovative Education`2014-03-10`<p class="declaration">This article was automatically crawled from the old Shandong Experimental High School's English Website by SEHS Crawler and is for archival purposes only. Its contents may be outdated and/or no longer relevant.</p><p>On the afternoon of March, 7th, SEHS invited Siyue Wang, professor of Shandong University, to make an innovative education report titled “change study concepts and be wise and useful” for Senior One students. Professor Siyue Wang now takes positions as director of Shandong University Invention and Creation Workshop, specialist of Ministry of Education “Degree and Graduates Education Development Center”, leader of Chinese Education Academy Innovative Education Research and Practice Specialist Group, panel of Chinese Teenager Technology Innovation Competition, counselor of Chinese Ministry of Education Development Research Center and member of Wuhan University “Daoyu Liu Education Endowment” committee. He’s specialized for “Innovative Theory Research” and “Enlightenment Education”. </p><p>In the report, Professor Wang first asked two questions: “What are elite people? Are people with PhD elite people?”. He pointed out that as an elite, the person must own outstanding concepts and beliefs, intense ability of understanding and also ability of innovation output. Professor Wang pointed out that a person can not learn everything and the learned knowledge can not be used efficiently in every field. Thus, we should educate students depending on their personal characteristics and interested fields. On the other hand, Professor Wang emphasized that “concept” is the compass of human life. We should change old and rotten educational concepts and learn new and innovative ones. “If there is no change in concept, all demanding voices shall be noise.” Professor Wang also told us that we should know exactly what is “learning”, what we’ve learned and the mechanisms behind the learning process instead of blindly engulf knowledge. At last, Professor Wang stated the difference and connection between “knowledgeable” and “wise”, pointing out that knowledge is “public” while “wise” is private. Thus, we should turn learning knowledge to wisely learning knowledge and we should not put too many efforts on memorizing. </p><p>During the whole report, Professor Wang provided suggestions to our students constantly, gaining warm applause again and again. Professor Wang said “Ability of understanding is the soul of invention and innovation”. This report is a composing part of our school’s 7th technology festival, enlightening path for our student’s creativity. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/140319142018281.jpg" /><p>                                                                                                            Translated by: Xu, Weizhe</p><p>                                                                                                             Edited by: Ji, Jingren</p>`http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2014-03/140319142018281.jpg;

Not long after, the “fingerprint tree” was filled with people’s fingerprints in various colors. The box with small tasks to make better environment in it also appealed to passers-by to draw tasks from the box and promise to practice them. Throughout the process, members of Root &Bud Club gave haze-proof masks as gifts to people who supported the protection of environment and they also received donation from people concerning for air condition and environment.</p><p>This activity, with the theme of “paying attention to haze and maintaining blue sky”, advertised the concept of environmental protection; at the same time, the experience enhanced the Root &Bud Club members’ social responsibility and ability of practice as well, which could be regarded as a remarkable success.

Kids can all study comfortably and quietly because of the well-equipped facilities and tender care from the teaching staff. At the beginning of the activity, the children there were shy and not willing to talk much, but after a while, our students and children started to become familiar with each other. Kids also showed gifts they received last night on the Christmas party and they proudly talked about some English words learned from the Santa Claus. Although all of these kids could barely sense the light, seeing nothing in their eyes, this situation could not stop their hope to feel the outside world. Fortunately, these children were very sensitive to rhythm. Some of them were able to play the piano and others could play the ocarina. One of them was able to play more than 20 kinds of instruments. Students from SEHS were very amazed at their brilliant musical performance despite their disabilities. </p><p>When our students were ready to leave, the kids waved their hands with warm smiles on their faces. After this experience in the Special Education Center, Director Ms. Li said that what those children really needed was mental support instead of only material help.</p><p>Students of SEHS think that everyone should try to love and care for others in daily life, giving a hand to anyone who needs our help.

Its contents may be outdated and/or no longer relevant.</p><p>On Dec. 23rd, from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., the 2013 Christmas party was held in the Reading Room and Lounge of the International Department of Shandong Experimental High School(SEHS) with  the Christmas carol “Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle All the Way”.</p><p>This party was organized by foreign teacher Katie. There were all together 4 locations in which two foreign teachers took charge of one  location. The main location was the Reading Room where food was provided and the game “Guess Who” took place. “Musical Chairs”  in Lounge attracted a lot of students to participate in. Besides, “Christmas Trivia” and “Christmas Pictionary” were held in two classrooms on the third floor respectively. Students chose their group randomly. Every activity rotated every fifteen minutes so that every student had access to take part in each game. In the last 20 minutes, all the participants enjoyed the Christmas carol performance by foreign teachers and A Cappella Group. </p><p>There were three highlights in this party:</p><p>First of all, the party comes with very professional planning and organization. Foreign teacher Katie spent a lot of time and energy in collecting suggestions and resources and recruiting volunteers. Moreover, she also made a lot of materials used in the party printed and posters. This careful planning not only enriched the variety of the activity but also made the party organized. </p><p>Secondly, the party thrived with a high degree of participation. Everyone proposed their own advice on the party. In “Guess Who” activity, teachers and students tried their best to find their baby pictures, put them on the specialized paper, numbered them and designed game sheets. Almost all teachers took part in decorating the locations. During the game, all students were divided into groups and interacted with teachers present. In a word, everyone was both organizer and participant.</p><p>Thirdly, more attention was paid to cultural experience of Christmas. This party characterized Christmas. “Guess Who” reminded us of the past; all were absorbed in the Christmas carol; “Christmas Trivia” expanded students’ background knowledge of Christmas; “Pictionary” enriched the students’ Christmas vocabulary; “Musical Chairs” let the students experience the party in a new way. One student parent’s play of cucurbit flute won acclamation from the audience. </p><p>This party was a real cultural experience for western Christmas and a platform for blending Chinese and western cultures. It witnessed both the students’ fellowship and interaction of emotion between teachers and students. It would be a cherished memory for both teachers and students even many years passed.</p><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/140102095588421.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/140102095588423.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/140102095588422.jpg" />`http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2014-01/140102095588421.jpg;http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2014-01/140102095588423.jpg;http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2014-01/140102095588422.jpg;
