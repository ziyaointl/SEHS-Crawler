They were divided into 4 virtual companies each with 48 persons. They combined science, technology,  engineering science, art and math organically to complete a perfect engineering project cooperatively.  During the competition, contestants have increased their abilities of team-working, problems-solving  and project-managing greatly.</p><p>Those contestants are required to undergo 25-hour extreme study in the last stage, designing a space  city with a capacity of 400 people in the Martian lava tube, which demanded the knowledge of  structure material, performance, basic equipment, living environment, automaton, robot, project  period and project price.  </p><p>Finally the champion team that is formed by Hangzhou Foreign Language School, Beijing No.11 High  School and the Middle School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Nanjing Foreign Language  School and our SEHS won the last championship. Thus, Shandong Experimental High School, Hangzhou  Foreign Language School and Beijing No. 11 High School will join the semifinal in New Delhi next year  and try to get the eligibility for final in Kennedy Space Center in the US.</p><p>ISSDC have already been 30 years by far. Since 2001, The Boeing Company and NASA became the  sponsors for the competition. It has become the weightiest competition in this domain. Every year  there are plenty of student groups from America and Europe join it.

A boy said these  words maturely: “Father, I will say something that I have never said before, father I love you! Thank  you for raising me for 18 years! You should smoke less, go for business travels less and take care of  your health. Your son will remember the instructions and my hometown when going abroad and study hard  to be outstanding. Wait for my return!” The father said these words with tears: “My son, the road of  one’s life is long, I will trust you anytime during your life. When going abroad, do not forget your  motherland, make yourself mature and contribute to the society by using your actions. You should also  repay the teachers who have taught you and serve the country.”</p><p>During this period when we are all experiencing economic integration and cultural diversity,  cultivating the state consciousness and the national spirit seems to be more and more important for  teenagers.

They participated in a splendid conversation “Literature and Life” with Mo Yan, the  winner of Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012 and the French writer  Le Clézio, the winner of Nobel Prize in  Literature in 2008. This activity was hosted by the vice headmaster of Shandong University and Xu Jun,  professor in The French Department of School of foreign languages of Nanjing University who served as the  translator during this conversation.　　</p><p>In the conversation Dr. Mo talked about his comprehension of Literature and Life by combining the  experiences of listening to the stories in the miserable childhood. He said everyone was a potential reader  and literature had a silent transforming influence on everybody so writers are responsible for writing the  most valuable, embedded and personal experiences into their works and trying to present the stereo  goodness and wickedness of humanity because writers could describe the characters concretely and  veritably, make readers be moved, remember it and have an inspiration of life. Mr. Mo said that as a writer,  he always felt his pen extremely heavy.</p><p>Dr. Clézio said he once experienced wars and famines in his childhood but after contacting with literature he  ignited the fire of hope in darkness and predicament. He felt that he was wistful to inherit the infinite  strength provided by the earth. He also mentioned the responsibilities of being a writer. He acknowledged  that there is always pain in life and emphasized that the function of literature is scattering a handful of salt  on life even if it is painful in order to give life some flavors. While writing, authors should put themselves  into the situation of others life and experiences and reflect the humanity using the pen in hand.</p><p>  As regards to the comprehension of Chinese and French cultures, Dr. Mo deemed that French authors not  only convey French spirit of freedom and romance but also French people’s devotion to pursuing freedom.  Dr. Clézio thought that Chinese literature has tremendous imaginations combined with distinctive charisma  of Chinese culture. He unfeignedly concluded that Chinese mythology replenishes Chinese soil by literature.  Since the “Innovative and Experimental Class” was established, our school has been organizing  face-to-face discussions and research between students and their mentors and providedopportunities for  them to participate in Shandong University’s academic activities. Participating in the “Literature Class” was  exactly part of the curriculums of Shandong University. </p><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/150116132173391.jpg" /><img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/150116132173392.jpg" /><p>Translated by Li Andi&Zhang Mengyuan</p><p>Edited by Wang Chunxiao</p>`http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2015-01/150116132173391.jpg;http://www.sdshiyan.cn/english/upload/2015-01/150116132173392.jpg;
